RAPL tools
==========

This is a collection of tools used to experiment with the Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) feature found in Intel processors. The results of the experiments have been published in my Master's thesis and two papers:

The code was originally written to run on Scientific Linux 6 but it should also compile and run on newer Linux distributions.
